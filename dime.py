class DIME:

    """ Distance to Modelled Embedding (DIME)
    
    This is a scikit-learn-esque PyTorch-implementation of DIME as described by SjÃ¶gren & Trygg and
    is used to enable ANNs detect out-of distribution observations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r2_threshold : float, int (default 0.99)
        Either a float between 0 and 1, which indicate the ratio of explained
        variance threshold used to determine the rank of the hyperplane approximation,
        or an int that specifies the rank directly.

    Examples
    --------
    Given a 2D-tensor, fit the hyperplane.

    >>> x = torch.tensor(...) # N x P torch 2D float-tensor.
    >>> modelled_embedding = DIME().fit(x)

    To obtain probabilities, calibrate percentiles. Preferably against
    separate dataset. Chaining is fine.:

    >>> x_cal = torch.tensor(...)  # N_cal x P torch 2D float-tensor.
    >>> modelled_embedding = DIME().fit(x).calibrate(x_cal)

    Given fitted hyperplane, you can calculate distances on new observations:

    >>> x_new = torch.tensor(...)  # N_new x P 2D float-tensor.
    >>> modelled_embedding.distance_to_hyperplane(x_new)  # -> 1D float-tensor, length N_new

    To obtain probabilities of that the new observations have a distance
    calibration set observations are equal or less than the new distance,
    you need to have calibrated the percentiles as shown above. Then you
    receive the probablities by passing `return_probablities`-keyword:

    >>> modelled_embedding.distance_to_hyperplane(x_new, return_probabilites=True) # -> 1D float-tensor, length N_new

    You can also use the alternative formulation of distance within the hyperplane, optionally as probabilities:

    >>> modelled_embedding.distance_within_hyperplane(x_new)  # -> 1D float-tensor, length N_new
